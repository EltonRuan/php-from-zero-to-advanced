## Objective

This repository was created with two main goals:

1. **To document my complete learning path** in PHP — from the very basics to advanced and complex topics — in a structured and practical way.
2. **To share knowledge with others** who are also interested in mastering PHP by providing open access to examples, explanations, and real-world projects.

Whether you're just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding of PHP, I hope this guide helps you learn effectively and build confidently.


## Target Audience

- Beginners who want a complete and practical roadmap.
- Developers looking to revisit PHP with updated practices.
- Anyone interested in building real projects with PHP.

## Learning Stages

This guide is organized by **stages**, not weeks — allowing you to learn at your own pace and dive deep into each area before moving forward.

### ✅ Stage 1: Language Fundamentals
- Syntax, variables, data types
- Operators and expressions
- Control structures (`if`, `else`, `switch`, loops)
- Superglobals (`$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SERVER`, etc.)
- Basic error handling

### ✅ Stage 2: Working with Forms and User Input
- Handling form data securely
- Validation and sanitization
- Dynamic form generation
- File uploads

### ✅ Stage 3: Arrays and Functions
- Indexed and associative arrays
- Array manipulation functions
- Creating reusable functions
- Scopes, parameters, and return types
- Anonymous functions and closures

### ✅ Stage 4: Files, Sessions, and State
- File reading/writing (`fopen`, `file_get_contents`)
- Sessions and cookies
- Login/logout systems
- Storing and retrieving data from JSON files

### ✅ Stage 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes, objects, methods, and properties
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
- Interfaces and abstract classes
- Namespaces and autoloading
- Dependency management with Composer

### ✅ Stage 6: Working with Databases
- Connecting to MySQL using `PDO`
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Prepared statements and SQL injection prevention
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Basic database schema design

### ✅ Stage 7: APIs and Integration
- Consuming external APIs (using `cURL` and `file_get_contents`)
- Working with JSON and XML
- Building your own RESTful API with PHP
- Token-based authentication (JWT)

### ✅ Stage 8: Advanced Topics
- Error and exception handling
- Email sending (SMTP with PHPMailer)
- Pagination and filtering
- Regex in PHP
- Uploading and processing images
- Security best practices (XSS, CSRF, input filtering)

### ✅ Stage 9: Utilities and Integrations
- Sending emails with native `mail()` function and PHPMailer
- Email formatting (HTML content, attachments)
- Generating PDF files with libraries like FPDF or Dompdf
- Exporting data to CSV
- Logging and custom log files
- Building dynamic reports from a database
- Automating daily tasks (ex: send daily report via email)

### ✅ Stage 10: Modern PHP Without Frameworks
- Manual routing using $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] and a custom Router class
- Building a lightweight MVC structure from scratch
- Organizing the application into controllers, models, and views
- Creating a simple templating system using native PHP (include, require, output buffering)
- Managing environment settings with a basic .env file parser (no external libraries)
- Autoloading classes using spl_autoload_register() or Composer if needed


## Final Considerations

This is not just a personal notebook — it's a resource for anyone who wants to grow with PHP. Let’s learn together, build real applications, and explore what PHP is truly capable of.
